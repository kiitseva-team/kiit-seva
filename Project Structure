KIIT SEVA is a comprehensive campus management platform designed to enhance student, staff, and faculty experiences at KIIT University. The project streamlines essential campus services by providing three core modules: Teacher Booking, Vehicle Tracking, and Feedback Management.
Students can easily browse and book timeslots to meet faculty for guidance or project work, with available slots visible and reservations managed efficiently. The vehicle tracking feature enables real-time location monitoring of campus buses and staff vehicles, helping users plan transport and view current route information. The feedback system empowers students, staff, and faculty to submit anonymous suggestions or rate services, allowing administrators to gather insights and continuously improve campus operations.
Built with PHP, HTML, Bulma CSS for styling, and MySQL for all data storage, KIIT SEVA is optimized for reliability, simplicity, and accessibility. User authentication supports three distinct roles—student, teacher, and staff—delivering personalized dashboards and functionality for each group. With a modern, mobile-friendly and unified design, the platform ensures all users have quick access to essential services, making campus life more organized, transparent, and user-centric.
